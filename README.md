# Julia_-EK-gravity-estimation

I'm teaching myself Julia, as well as calibrate the trade cost based on Eaton-Kortum model.

Download the `Bilateraltrade.csv`. I will also add the code used to clean and construct the panel bilateral trade data later.

After running code, you will obtain bilateral trade cost matrix from 1996 - 2015. 

# Environment

The code is complied on Anaconda-Jupyter. To interact with Julia, install the `IJulia` package by using `Pkg.add("IJulia")`

<!-- First, download the data from CEPII: http://www.cepii.fr/CEPII/en/bdd_modele/bdd_modele_item.asp?id=8. The data contain the trade flow and geographical variables we usually used for quantitative trade model.

Second, download the attached ctypairAna.csv. it contains 40 countries so 40 * 40 country pair -->
